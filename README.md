# HoloLens2_ImaginaryFriend 
I managed to get this simple interactive hologram demonstration from Roland Smeenk running on the HoloLens 2.

This is an update version of my hologram friend Timmy from my previous video.
Timmy can now be placed onto flat surfaces, has some new snarky commentary and has a little piano next to him that can be interacted with using hand tracking.
